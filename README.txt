Welcome. Welcome to Helmet 1.0



You have chosen, or been chosen, to test one of my finest creations! (I hope you know the game lol)


Let's get it fast:

1. To check my Homework, just open this link and download the zip file

2. To check my Final Project, download the zip file, and move the Helmet folder to your workspace (this one location is very important)

P.S. I had to add these links because GitHub has storage limits, so it couldn't load the files entirely :(


How to start the Helmet code? Easy!

1. Open the Helmet folder, then find the Code folder and find inside it the Main.py file. Run it by using VSC (Visual Studio Code) or other apps that run python
2. During verification, do not modify any files (Saveit.py strictly)
3. In case there are problems, contact me on Discord (nickname: @linozimo)


Libraries used:

1. pip install pygame
2. pip install pandas
3. pip install torch
4. pip install transformers
5. pip install opencv-python


ATTENTION!!!

1. Be careful, some icons can get larger if you don't use a 1080x1920 monitor. If the size is smaller or bigger, the resolution will break (that's a problem that will be fixed after the bootcamp ends, sorry)
2. The Final Project size is 1.32 GB (1,418,039,296 bytes), make sure to check your space before downloading it
